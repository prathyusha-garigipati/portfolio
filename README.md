# Portfolio — Prathyusha

This is a simple static portfolio site built with HTML, CSS and a tiny bit of JavaScript.

Quick preview

- Open the site locally (macOS):

```bash
open "$(pwd)/html/index.html"
```

- Or from the project root (replace path if needed):

```bash
open "/Users/prathyushagartigipati/Desktop/portfolio/html/index.html"
```

What I added

- Mobile-friendly nav with toggle
- Hero with avatar and CTAs
- Project thumbnails and short case-study bullets
- Reveal-on-scroll animations using IntersectionObserver
- Contact form with client-side validation (demo only)
- Printable `html/resume.html` page and favicon + placeholder images

Replace placeholders

- Replace `images/avatar.svg`, `images/project1.svg`, `images/project2.svg`, and `images/favicon.svg` with your real images.
- Add your `Prathyusha_Resume.pdf` next to `html/resume.html` or update the link to point to your resume.

Deploy

- This is static — you can deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host.

Next improvements

- Add live demo and GitHub links for each project.
- Wire contact form to a service (Formspree, Netlify Forms, EmailJS) or add a serverless function.
- Add analytics and accessibility checks.
